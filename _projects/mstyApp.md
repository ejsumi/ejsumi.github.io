I recently stumbled across \[Msty](https://msty.app/), and it solved a problem I'd been having for some time.



Here's the thing - I wanted to try ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro, but I'm not a heavy AI user. Paying $20 every month when I might use it a few times felt like throwing money away.



Some days you're in the mood to experiment, but the free tier isn't enough. Msty solved this perfectly - you just plug in your API key and pay for what you use. No monthly guilt, no "I better use this 20 times to get my money's worth" pressure.



\*\*Switching Between Different AI Models\*\*



What's cool is you can connect multiple APIs - Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, you name it. I can ask the same question to different models and compare their responses. Ever wondered "Would GPT-4 answer this differently than Claude?" Now you can find out without juggling different apps.



The whole setup works seamlessly without making you mess with API endpoints or technical configurations.



They also let you run smaller models locally on your machine for basic tasks. You get a list of featured local models with compatibility scores for your laptop. One glance tells you which model suits your needs and hardware best.



It's like having a Swiss Army knife for AI.



\*\*Knowledge Stack - Your Personal AI Library\*\*



This feature genuinely impressed me. You can upload your documents and use either local or remote AI models for embeddings. The settings are customizable, but the defaults work fine for most cases.



I tested this for my kid's exam prep. After uploading previous years' question papers, I asked Claude (through Msty) to generate similar practice questions. The results were spot-on. The AI understood the format, difficulty level, and topics - creating new questions that matched the requirements.



Setting up took minutes. Paste your API key, drag and drop your files, and done. They even recommend which local models will run smoothly on your specific hardware.



\*\*The Real Cost Savings\*\*



Instead of paying for subscriptions I barely use, my actual API usage costs under $1 per month. For someone who needs AI occasionally but wants the best models when I do, this approach makes perfect sense.



Running local models for simple tasks cuts costs even further.



\*\*Who Should Try This?\*\*



If you're a beginner wanting access to top-tier models without expensive monthly commitments, Msty is worth exploring. It's handy for personal projects where your AI needs fluctuate. Some weeks, I don't do any AI learning; other weeks, I'm experimenting with AI. Now I only pay for what I use.



I found Msty a powerful ally. It's not trying to be everything to everyone - just a straightforward way to access AI models without subscription overhead.



Give it a try if you're on the fence about AI subscriptions but still want to experiment with the good stuff. Sometimes the best tools are the ones that stay out of your way and let you focus on getting things done.
