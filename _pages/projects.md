### **Principal Consultant @ Infosys, Finacle(2016 – Present)**

**Driving content systems evolution and GenAI adoption for a multi-product digital banking suite**

### 🔧 **From SharePoint to Sitecore: A Strategic Platform Shift**

In 2022, I led the full migration of our enterprise knowledge portal — not because it failed, but because it outgrew its purpose.

- **Why we moved:**
    
    SharePoint 2013 was reaching end-of-life, and our product suite had evolved from monolithic apps to a platform-based, microservices architecture. The old Information Architecture couldn’t scale with this growth, and our SharePoint portal dev team had migrated to open-source stacks. We needed a **future-ready, flexible platform** — fast.
    
- **What I did:**
    
    My manager and I evaluated different platform options, presented a Sitecore business case to senior leadership, and got approval. Then came the heavy lift:
    
    - **Redesigned the IA** to reflect the new product structure while mapping 1TB of legacy content into the new model.
    - **Remodeled metadata strategy** to ensure search relevance and scalability.
    - **Coordinated across multiple teams** — product, engineering, security, data privacy, infra — to align with enterprise standards.
    - **Partnered with the implementation team** to test each feature under tight delivery timelines and provide ongoing feedback.
    - **Drove launch readiness** — created onboarding guides, planned internal/external comms, and incorporated user feedback into post-launch refinements.

> Result: A modern, secure, scalable publishing platform that supports evolving product architecture and accelerates future AI integration.

### 💬 **GenAI Enablement at Scale**

While I didn’t build KnowledgeGPT myself, I played a major role in its adoption and rollout:

- Collaborated with the AI team to bring **ChatGPT-style search** into the knowledge platform.
- Led prompt strategy and internal use-case validation.
- Rolled out tools like a **language review assistant** and a **prompt repository**, helping our writers extract, comprehend, and standardize content, reducing review overhead by 70%.

### 🔁 **End-to-End Platform Ownership**

- Manage the **publishing portal roadmap**: features, releases, vendor collaboration, and continuous UX improvements.
- Onboard and support partners, internal teams, and customers across content access and usage.
- Leading a team of 5, handling the knowledge platform and content delivery of Digital Banking products, while coordinating across multiple teams.
