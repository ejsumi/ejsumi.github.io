**Hi, I’m Sumi — a Product and Technology Leader with 19+ years of experience building and scaling enterprise knowledge and enablement platforms, with a growing focus on practical, governed AI adoption.**

My work centers on translating emerging AI capabilities into solutions that solve real operational problems at scale. At EdgeVerve, I led cross-functional initiatives to introduce GenAI into enterprise knowledge systems, including the rollout of KnowledgeGPT — a RAG-based assistant supporting 35+ banking products. These initiatives reduced content review effort by up to 70%, improved information discoverability, and enhanced support experiences for global users.

I currently own and evolve knowledge platforms, combining strong product ownership with hands-on experimentation in AI, automation, and analytics. I work closely with engineering, AI teams, content specialists, and business stakeholders to ensure solutions are not only technically sound but also usable, compliant, and widely adopted.

Whether it’s enabling prompt-driven workflows to improve productivity, modernizing search with AI-assisted metadata, or using data to guide platform decisions, my focus remains consistent: making AI practical, scalable, and aligned to real business value.
