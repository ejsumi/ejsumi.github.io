**Hi, I’m Sumi — a Strategic Product & Technology Leader with 18+ years of experience driving AI-powered transformation across enterprise content and knowledge platforms.**

I specialize in turning emerging AI tools into scalable, high-impact solutions. At EdgeVerve, I led the cross-functional rollout of *KnowledgeGPT*, a GenAI-powered assistant deployed across 40+ digital banking products — streamlining content delivery, cutting review cycles by 70%, and enhancing user support experiences.

As the owner of our publishing platform and knowledge systems, I combine deep product ownership with hands-on AI prototyping to solve real-world problems. My work bridges engineering, content, and stakeholder teams - ensuring that innovations don’t just get built, but actually get adopted.

Whether it’s driving prompt-based tools to boost writer productivity or re-architecting search with AI-enhanced metadata, my focus is simple: **make AI practical, scalable, and business-aligned.**
