# Hi, I’m Sumi 👋

I write about **documentation platforms, knowledge management, AI in content, and product thinking**.

I work on documentation and knowledge systems that help people find the right information when they need it. At EdgeVerve, I’ve led efforts to introduce Generative AI into enterprise knowledge platforms, including rolling out a RAG-based assistant used across 35+ banking products. The AI tools and prompt templates have helped to reduce the review effort by 70% and improve readability and usability.

Today, I own and evolve enterprise knowledge platforms, blending documentation strategy with hands-on work in automation, analytics, and platform improvements. I collaborate closely with writers, engineers, AI teams, and business stakeholders to ensure documentation is accurate, compliant, and actually adopted.

Whether I’m improving review workflows, refining search and metadata, or using data to guide platform decisions, my focus stays the same: building documentation systems that scale, support real work, and deliver clear value to users.
