I've been hearing a lot about AI agents - what they are, how they differ from regular ChatGPT/Copilot. Here's what I've learned from working with them.

## What Actually Is an AI Agent?

Here's the thing - when you use ChatGPT or Copilot, you ask a question, get an answer, then ask another question. It's a conversation. You're in control of every step.

AI agents flip this dynamic. You give them a goal, and they figure out how to get there. They don't wait for you to tell them what to do next - they plan, execute, check results, adjust, and keep going until the job is done.

Think of it like the difference between giving someone turn-by-turn directions versus just telling them the destination. One requires constant input from you; the other handles navigation independently.


## The Agent Loop - How It Works

Behind the scenes, AI agents run what's called an "agent loop." It's basically a cycle that repeats until your task is complete:

- Remember what's happened so far
- Decide what to do next
- Execute the action
- Check the result
- Update the memory with what worked (or didn't)
- Decide whether to continue or stop

It's how you'd work through a complex project yourself - except the agent does this in minutes instead of hours.

## What Makes Up an AI Agent?

**Memory**  
The agent's record of what's happened. It tracks your request, what actions it's taken, what worked, what failed. Without memory, the agent would repeat mistakes or lose track of progress.

**Rules**  
These define what the agent can and cannot do. Think of rules as the agent's job description - its boundaries, capabilities, and guidelines for behavior.

**Tools**  
The actual functions the agent can perform. Read files. Query databases. Send emails. Search the web. Create reports. Without tools, the agent can only talk about doing things - it can't actually do them.

## Regular AI vs. Agentic AI

**Regular Generative AI:**
- You: "Write a product description"
- AI: [writes description]
- You: "Make it shorter"
- AI: [makes it shorter]
- You: "Check it against brand voice"
- AI: [checks it]

You're driving every step.

**Agentic AI:**
- You: "Create a product description that matches our brand voice and is under 150 words"
- AI: "Let me check your brand guidelines... drafting... checking word count... making adjustments... Done. Here's the description."

The AI is driving.

## What Makes Agentic AI Different

**Flipped Interaction**  
Instead of you asking 20 questions, the AI might ask you 2-3 clarifying questions upfront, then goes off and completes the work.

**Adaptive Planning**  
Hits a roadblock? The agent adjusts its approach. Missing information? It searches for it or asks you. Error in step 3? It modifies steps 4 and 5 accordingly.

**Translation Layer**  
You say: "Pull last quarter's support tickets and identify common issues."  
The agent translates that into database queries, data analysis, pattern recognition, and report generation.  
You get: A summary without writing code or manually reviewing hundreds of tickets.

## Real Example - Reviewing UI Literals

One task that comes up regularly in documentation work is reviewing UI literals - the text strings that appear in software interfaces like button labels, error messages, and menu items.

**The Old Way:**  
The developers sends over a spreadsheet with new UI literals for an upcoming release. The writer needs to:
- Check each literal against our style guide rules (capitalization, punctuation, word choice)
- Get clarity from the product team on the context and requirements
- Comes from multiple developers, in sprints

This takes several hours of focused, tedious work. Miss one inconsistency, and it ships to users.

**With an AI Agent:**  
Give the agent: "Review these 200 new literals against our style guide rules and our verified literal list. Flag anything that doesn't match patterns or rules."

The agent:
- Loads the style guide rules (title casing, no periods in labels, specific terminology requirements)
- Compares each new literal against the guidelines
- Identifies 23 literals that don't follow capitalization rules
- Flags 8 literals using terminology that differs from established patterns (like "Remove" vs standard "Delete")
- Creates a report categorizing issues by type with specific recommendations

The writer reviews the flagged items, gets clarity from the product team, and does the needful. The pattern-matching work? Handled.

What makes this powerful is consistency. The agent doesn't get tired on literal 150 and start missing things. It applies the same rigor to every single item.

## Types of AI Agents

**Simple Reflex Agents**  
Follow basic "if this, then that" rules. If someone asks about pricing, show the pricing page. Straightforward but limited.

**Goal-Based Agents**  
Work toward specific objectives. "Identify the inconsistencies in the terminologies used, and provide steps to fix the," The agent figures out how to achieve that goal.

**Learning Agents**  
Get better over time. Based on user interactions and instructions, the responses changes overtime.

## The Reality Check

Let me be clear - AI agents aren't magic.

**You're Still the Boss**  
Set the goals. Define the rules. Review the results. The agent executes; you provide strategy and judgment.

**Start Small**  
Test with low-risk tasks first. Don't hand over mission-critical work until you've seen how the agent performs on simpler tasks.

**Oversight Matters**  
Agents make mistakes. They can go off track. You need to review their work, especially initially.

**Human Judgment Can't Be Replaced**  
Use agents for execution and coordination. Keep strategic thinking, ethical considerations, and creative decisions in human hands.

## What This Means for Your Team

**More Time for Strategy**  
Your team spends less time on repetitive tasks and more time on work that actually needs human creativity and judgment.

**Faster Execution**  
Things that took days now take hours. Give the task with proper guidelines and let the agent handle it.

**Consistency**  
The agent follows rules every time. No shortcuts. No "I'll fix that later" moments. It does what it's supposed to do.


## Getting Started

Identify one repetitive, multi-step task that eats up your team's time. That's your first candidate for an AI agent.

It might be:
- Generating status reports from multiple data sources
- Reviewing and categorizing customer feedback
- Creating first drafts of proposals from templates
- Monitoring compliance across multiple systems

Pick something where the process is clear, the inputs are structured, and the stakes aren't too high if something goes wrong.

Test it. Refine it. Expand from there.

## The Bottom Line

AI agents aren't just fancy chatbots. They're systems that can handle complex, multi-step work with minimal hand-holding.

The technology is here. It's getting better fast. Companies figuring out how to use it effectively will have a competitive advantage.

The question isn't whether AI agents will change how we work - they already are. The question is: How will you put them to work on your team?
