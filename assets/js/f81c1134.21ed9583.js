Here\'s what I\'ve learned from working with them and managing teams that use them.\\n\\n## What Actually Is an AI Agent?\\n\\nHere\'s the thing - when you use ChatGPT or Copilot, you ask a question, get an answer, then ask another question. It\'s a conversation. You\'re in control of every step.\\n\\nAI agents flip this dynamic. You give them a goal, and they figure out how to get there. They don\'t wait for you to tell them what to do next - they plan, execute, check results, adjust, and keep going until the job is done.\\n\\nThink of it like the difference between giving someone turn-by-turn directions versus just telling them the destination. One requires constant input from you; the other handles navigation independently.\\n\\n\\n## The Agent Loop - How It Works\\n\\nBehind the scenes, AI agents run what\'s called an \\"agent loop.\\" It\'s basically a cycle that repeats until your task is complete:\\n\\n- Remember what\'s happened so far\\n- Decide what to do next\\n- Execute the action\\n- Check the result\\n- Update the memory with what worked (or didn\'t)\\n- Decide whether to continue or stop\\n\\nIt\'s how you\'d work through a complex project yourself - except the agent does this in minutes instead of hours.\\n\\n## What Makes Up an AI Agent?\\n\\n**Memory**  \\nThe agent\'s record of what\'s happened. It tracks your request, what actions it\'s taken, what worked, what failed. Without memory, the agent would repeat mistakes or lose track of progress.\\n\\n**Rules**  \\nThese define what the agent can and cannot do. Think of rules as the agent\'s job description - its boundaries, capabilities, and guidelines for behavior.\\n\\n**Tools**  \\nThe actual functions the agent can perform. Read files. Query databases. Send emails. Search the web. Create reports. Without tools, the agent can only talk about doing things - it can\'t actually do them.\\n\\n## Regular AI vs. Agentic AI\\n\\n**Regular Generative AI:**\\n- You: \\"Write a product description\\"\\n- AI: [writes description]\\n- You: \\"Make it shorter\\"\\n- AI: [makes it shorter]\\n- You: \\"Check it against brand voice\\"\\n- AI: [checks it]\\n\\nYou\'re driving every step.\\n\\n**Agentic AI:**\\n- You: \\"Create a product description that matches our brand voice and is under 150 words\\"\\n- AI: \\"Let me check your brand guidelines... drafting... checking word count... making adjustments... Done. Here\'s the description. I also noticed your competitor updated their description last week - want to see a comparison?\\"\\n\\nThe AI is driving.\\n\\n## What Makes Agentic AI Different\\n\\n**Flipped Interaction**  \\nInstead of you asking 20 questions, the AI might ask you 2-3 clarifying questions upfront, then goes off and completes the work.\\n\\n**Adaptive Planning**  \\nHits a roadblock? The agent adjusts its approach. Missing information? It searches for it or asks you. Error in step 3? It modifies steps 4 and 5 accordingly.\\n\\n**Translation Layer**  \\nYou say: \\"Pull last quarter\'s support tickets and identify common issues.\\"  \\nThe agent translates that into database queries, data analysis, pattern recognition, and report generation.  \\nYou get: A summary without writing code or manually reviewing hundreds of tickets.\\n\\n## Real Example - Reviewing UI Literals\\n\\nOne task that comes up regularly in documentation work is reviewing UI literals - the text strings that appear in software interfaces like button labels, error messages, and menu items.\\n\\n**The Old Way:**  \\nThe developers sends over a spreadsheet with new UI literals for an upcoming release. A writer needs to:\\n- Check each literal against our style guide rules (capitalization, punctuation, word choice)\\n- Get clarity from the product team on the context and requirements\\n- Comes from multiple developers, in sprints\\n\\nThis takes several hours of focused, tedious work. Miss one inconsistency, and it ships to users.\\n\\n**With an AI Agent:**  \\nI give the agent: \\"Review these 200 new literals against our style guide rules and our verified literal list. Flag anything that doesn\'t match patterns or rules.\\"\\n\\nThe agent:\\n- Loads the style guide rules (sentence case for buttons, no periods in labels, specific terminology requirements)\\n- Compares each new literal against the existing verified literals in our database\\n- Identifies 23 literals that don\'t follow capitalization rules\\n- Flags 8 literals using terminology that differs from established patterns (like \\"Remove\\" vs our standard \\"Delete\\")\\n- Spots 5 literals that are suspiciously similar to existing ones but with slight variations\\n- Creates a report categorizing issues by type with specific recommendations\\n\\nThe writer reviews the flagged items, makes decisions on the genuine edge cases, and focuses on the 15 literals that actually need human judgment. The pattern-matching work? Handled.\\n\\nWhat makes this powerful is consistency. The agent doesn\'t get tired on literal 150 and start missing things. It applies the same rigor to every single item.\\n\\n## Types of AI Agents\\n\\n**Simple Reflex Agents**  \\nFollow basic \\"if this, then that\\" rules. If someone asks about pricing, show the pricing page. Straightforward but limited.\\n\\n**Goal-Based Agents**  \\nWork toward specific objectives. \\"Reduce customer support tickets by improving documentation.\\" The agent figures out how to achieve that goal.\\n\\n**Learning Agents**  \\nGet better over time. They learn which documentation formats get better user engagement and adapt their approach accordingly.\\n\\n## The Reality Check\\n\\nLet me be clear - AI agents aren\'t magic.\\n\\n**You\'re Still the Boss**  \\nSet the goals. Define the rules. Review the results. The agent executes; you provide strategy and judgment.\\n\\n**Start Small**  \\nTest with low-risk tasks first. Don\'t hand over mission-critical work until you\'ve seen how the agent performs on simpler tasks.\\n\\n**Oversight Matters**  \\nAgents make mistakes. They can go off track. You need to review their work, especially initially.\\n\\n**Human Judgment Can\'t Be Replaced**  \\nUse agents for execution and coordination. Keep strategic thinking, ethical considerations, and creative decisions in human hands.\\n\\n## What This Means for Your Team\\n\\n**More Time for Strategy**  \\nYour team spends less time on repetitive tasks and more time on work that actually needs human creativity and judgment.\\n\\n**Faster Execution**  \\nThings that took days now take hours. Multi-step processes that required constant coordination? The agent handles them.\\n\\n**Consistency**  \\nThe agent follows rules every time. No shortcuts. No \\"I\'ll fix that later\\" moments. It does what it\'s supposed to do.\\n\\n**Scalability**  \\nHandle more work without hiring more people. The agent doesn\'t get tired or overwhelmed.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nIdentify one repetitive, multi-step task that eats up your team\'s time. That\'s your first candidate for an AI agent.\\n\\nIt might be:\\n- Generating status reports from multiple data sources\\n- Reviewing and categorizing customer feedback\\n- Creating first drafts of proposals from templates\\n- Monitoring compliance across multiple systems\\n\\nPick something where the process is clear, the inputs are structured, and the stakes aren\'t too high if something goes wrong.\\n\\nTest it. Refine it. Expand from there.\\n\\n## The Bottom Line\\n\\nAI agents aren\'t just fancy chatbots. They\'re systems that can handle complex, multi-step work with minimal hand-holding.\\n\\nThe technology is here. It\'s getting better fast. Companies figuring out how to use it effectively will have a competitive advantage.\\n\\nThe question isn\'t whether AI agents will change how we work - they already are. The question is: How will you put them to work on your team?"},{"id":"/2025/10/02/copilitusage","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/10/02/copilitusage","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-02-copilitusage.md","title":"My Daily Workflow with Enterprise Copilot: A Technical Writer\'s Field Notes","description":"Field notes from using Microsoft Enterprise Copilot as a technical writer \u2014 prompting strategies, real use cases, and what actually works for drafting and reviewing docs.","date":"2025-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Gen AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/gen-ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"AI Tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai-tools"},{"inline":true,"label":"Technical Writing","permalink":"/blog/tags/technical-writing"}],"readingTime":5.33,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"My Daily Workflow with Enterprise Copilot: A Technical Writer\'s Field Notes","description":"Field notes from using Microsoft Enterprise Copilot as a technical writer \u2014 prompting strategies, real use cases, and what actually works for drafting and reviewing docs.","tags":["Gen AI","AI Tools","Technical Writing"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding AI Agents","permalink":"/blog/2025/12/28/aiagents"},"nextItem":{"title":"Numpy: A Quick Reference","permalink":"/blog/2025/08/15/numpy"}},"content":"A few months ago, I shared my experience with [Msty as an AI aggregator](/blog/2025/08/08/msty) for personal AI projects. Today, I want to talk about how in work we use Enterprise Copilot in the technical writers team.\\n\\nHere\'s the thing - documentation work involves a lot of back-and-forth. You get requirements documents, user stories, and sometimes details in emails. Your job is to comprehend and abstract the data to create user guides and release notes. It takes time, multiple drafts, and constant clarifications because information is scattered and not complete.\\n\\nIn our organization, we have access to Enterprise Copilot, and due to data privacy issues, other AI chat tools are not allowed for project work.\\n\\n**From Blank Pages to First Drafts**\\n\\nBefore Copilot, creating the first draft took time. New features or technical terms would come up without context, and would need to spend hours figuring out what they meant. The gap in details or context could lead to incomplete documentation and more review cycles.\\n\\nI started experimenting with Copilot cautiously - simple prompts for language review. Generic requests like \\"improve this text\\" gave mediocre results. But when I got specific - \\"Review this paragraph for passive voice\\" or \\"Check if this matches our conversational tone\\" - the output improved.\\n\\nIt became clear that to get the expected outcome, Co-pilot required  clear instructions.\\n\\n**How I Actually Use It**\\n\\nTraining and guidelines are given to the team members on how to use Copilot. There is a set of prompt templates created for the various tasks in the team. If there are tweaks required for different products, the template is customized as required. This helps junior team members to generate drafts faster without starting from scratch. Also, it ensures that the output is consistent in tone and style.\\n\\nFor example: \\"Based on this SRS document, explain the core user workflow for [Product Name] in simple terms. List any assumptions you\'re making.\\"\\n\\nThis surfaces gaps early and gives everyone a solid starting point.\\n\\nFor style consistency, I use specific prompts: \\"Review this section for conversational tone, active voice, and second-person perspective. Highlight deviations.\\" It catches inconsistencies before documents reach reviewers.\\n\\n**Finding What\'s Missing**\\n\\nOne trick I love - using different personas to test the documents. I ask Copilot: \\"Act as a developer implementing this API. What information is missing? What questions would you have?\\"\\n\\nOr: \\"Act as a business analyst explaining this feature to stakeholders. What\'s unclear?\\"\\n\\nThis helps me spot gaps and create a list of questions for SMEs and product owners before lengthy review cycles start.\\n\\n**Working with Multiple Documents**\\n\\nEnterprise Copilot\'s ability to work with OneDrive links is useful. Instead of opening five different documents to cross-reference information, I upload links and query: \\"What are the differences in how authentication is described across these five documents?\\"\\n\\nThis surfaces inconsistencies and helps me create accurate abstractions of complex requirements.\\n\\n**Creating Templates Faster**\\n\\nRecently, when we needed a new document template, I asked Copilot to draft an outline based on the template\'s purpose, our existing formats, and standards. The initial draft wasn\'t perfect, but it accelerated iterations with the product team. What would have taken multiple meetings, happened in 1-2 focused sessions.\\n\\n**Building Glossaries**\\n\\nIdentifying terms for glossaries manually is a time-consuming activity. Now I upload documentation and ask: \\"Identify technical terms and acronyms that would need definitions for a non-technical audience.\\"\\n\\nIt\'s not always perfect - sometimes it flags common terms or misses domain-specific terms - but it gives a solid starting list to refine.\\n\\n**The Reality Check**\\n\\nLet me be clear: Enterprise Copilot isn\'t a silver bullet.\\n\\nGeneric prompts don\'t work. Different products have different input documents and formats. A prompt that works beautifully for one product may produce less desirable output for another. I\'ve had to fine-tune prompts for each scenario and teach my junior team members how to customize them for specific tasks.\\n\\nGuided adoption is critical. Initially, I told the team, \\"We have Copilot now, explore and use it.\\" Adoption was slow. When I started showing them exactly how to use it for their daily tasks - \\"Here\'s how you generate a first draft of user guide from user stories\\" - adoption improved dramatically. When guided for their daily tasks, people actually use it.\\n\\nAlways keep a human in the loop. I treat Copilot as a partner or thought assistant, not a replacement for critical thinking. Every output needs review. Every draft needs validation against source documents. AI accelerates the process; it doesn\'t make you less responsible.\\n\\nKnow when NOT to use it. For repetitive tasks that can be automated with Excel functions or scripts, I don\'t ask Copilot to generate the final output. Instead, I ask it how to use the right functions or create the script. For example: \\"What Excel function extracts dates from text in this format?\\" This teaches me the underlying skill rather than making me dependent on AI for every small task.\\n\\n**The Real Impact**\\n\\nUsing Enterprise Copilot has genuinely accelerated my documentation lifecycle. Drafts happen faster. Review cycles are shorter. Cross-functional collaboration is smoother. The team feels more confident experimenting with documentation early in the process.\\n\\nBut the tool is only as good as how you use it. Fine-tune your prompts. Understand your workflows. Keep learning. And always keep the human in the loop.\\n\\nThe core principle I started with remains true: GenAI accelerates content, streamlines processes, and manages knowledge efficiently. But how you implement it - the prompts you write, the workflows you design, the adoption strategies you use - that\'s where the real work happens.\\n\\nAnd that work? It\'s worth it.\\n\\n**Who Should Try This?**\\n\\nIf you are a knowledge worker and your organization has Enterprise Copilot (or similar tools), experiment with it hands-on. Start small with language review, then expand to drafting, then to gap analysis.\\n\\nBetter yet, show your junior team members exactly how to use it for their specific tasks. Don\'t just say \\"use AI\\" - demonstrate the actual prompts and workflows that work.\\n\\nSometimes the best tools are the ones that stay out of your way and let you focus on getting things done. Enterprise Copilot does that for me - not by replacing my work, but by accelerating the parts that used to slow everything down.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*What\'s your experience with AI tools in documentation work?

Paying $20 every month when I might use it a few times felt like throwing money away.\\n\\nSome days you\'re in the mood to experiment, but the free tier isn\'t enough. Msty solved this perfectly - you just plug in your API key and pay for what you use. No monthly guilt, no \\"I better use this 20 times to get my money\'s worth\\" pressure.\\n\\n**Switching Between Different AI Models**\\n\\nWhat\'s cool is you can connect multiple APIs - Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, you name it. I can ask the same question to different models and compare their responses. Ever wondered, \\"Would GPT-4 answer this differently than Claude?\\" Now you can find out without juggling different apps.\\n\\nThe whole setup works seamlessly without making you mess with API endpoints or technical configurations.\\n\\nThey also let you run smaller models locally on your machine for basic tasks.

One glance tells you which model suits your needs and hardware best.\\n\\nIt\'s like having a Swiss Army knife for AI.\\n\\n**Knowledge Stack - Your Personal AI Library**\\n\\nThis feature genuinely impressed me. You can upload your documents and use either local or remote AI models for embeddings. The settings are customizable, but the defaults work fine for most cases.\\n\\nI tested this for my kid\'s exam prep. After uploading previous years\' question papers, I asked Claude (through Msty) to generate similar practice questions. The results were spot-on.

Paste your API key, drag and drop your files, and done. They even recommend which local models will run smoothly on your specific hardware.\\n\\n\\n**The Real Cost Savings**\\n\\nInstead of paying for subscriptions I barely use, my actual API usage costs under $1 per month. For someone who needs AI occasionally but wants the best models when I do, this approach makes perfect sense.\\n\\nRunning local models for simple tasks cuts costs even further.\\n\\n**Who Should Try This?**\\n\\nIf you\'re a beginner wanting access to top-tier models without expensive monthly commitments, Msty is worth exploring. It\'s handy for personal projects where your AI needs fluctuate. Some weeks, I don\'t do any AI learning; other weeks, I\'m experimenting with AI.
