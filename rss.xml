            <description><![CDATA[I built a RAG POC not to ship a product, but to understand the system my documents feed into — and what it means to write content that AI can actually use.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ask for technical writers team is to make product documentation both human-readable and AI-readable. The idea is that if a RAG-based system is already being used in the knowledge portal to answer user questions, the quality of those answers depends entirely on how well-structured the source documents are. To understand on to make documents AI scalable, I need to actually understand how RAG works from the inside — not just conceptually, but what happens when you feed it a document and ask a question.</p>
<p>So I built a POC. I learned a lot more than I expected.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-rag-actually-is">What RAG Actually Is<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2026/02/14/rag-poc#what-rag-actually-is" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What RAG Actually Is" title="Direct link to What RAG Actually Is" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The short version: RAG lets you ask questions about documents that you upload.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about regular ChatGPT or any LLM — it only knows what it was trained on. Ask it about your internal policy document or a PDF from last week, and it either makes something up or tells you it doesn't know.</p>
<p>RAG fixes this. Not by retraining the model, but by retrieving the relevant parts of your document and feeding them to the model alongside your question. The model then generates an answer based on what you just handed it, not from memory.</p>
<p>There are two distinct phases:</p>
<p><strong>Indexing</strong> — happens once when you add documents:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">PDF → Extract Text → Chunk → Embed → Store in VectorDB</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Querying</strong> — happens every time someone asks a question:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Question → Embed → Search VectorDB → Retrieve Chunks → LLM → Answer</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The key insight that changed how I think about it: the LLM never "reads" your PDF. It only sees the handful of chunks that were retrieved as most relevant to the question. If the retrieval is off, the answer will be off — no matter how capable the model is.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-langchain-and-chromadb">Why LangChain and ChromaDB<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2026/02/14/rag-poc#why-langchain-and-chromadb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why LangChain and ChromaDB" title="Direct link to Why LangChain and ChromaDB" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I had a few options for how to build this. I went with LangChain as the orchestration layer and ChromaDB as the vector store, and the reason was simple: I wanted to get something working first and understand the concepts. Also, was doing a course on Langchain and RAG, so easier to go with what I was learning.</p>
<p><strong>What LangChain is:</strong> It's an open-source framework for building LLM-powered applications. Instead of writing all the plumbing yourself — API calls, prompt construction, memory management, retrieval logic — LangChain gives you composable building blocks. For this POC, the components I used were:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>ChatOpenAI</strong> — wrapper around OpenAI's chat model, handles API calls and response parsing</li>
<li class=""><strong>ConversationalRetrievalChain</strong> — the core chain that ties everything together: takes a question, retrieves relevant chunks, builds the prompt, calls the LLM, and returns the answer</li>
<li class=""><strong>ConversationBufferMemory</strong> — stores the chat history so follow-up questions work without re-asking context</li>
<li class=""><strong>PromptTemplate</strong> — structures exactly what gets sent to the LLM, including how context and question are combined</li>
<li class=""><strong>Retriever</strong> — the interface that queries ChromaDB and returns the top K matching chunks</li>
</ul>
<p>ChromaDB runs locally, requires no server setup, and stores vectors on disk. Together, they let you go from zero to a working Q&amp;A system in a few hours.</p>
<p>The tradeoff is real though. LangChain is a thick abstraction layer. You call high-level functions without fully seeing what's happening underneath — how the HTTP calls to the embedding API work, exactly how the similarity search runs, how context is being assembled before it hits the LLM. It works, but it hides the internals.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-i-actually-built">What I Actually Built<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2026/02/14/rag-poc#what-i-actually-built" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What I Actually Built" title="Direct link to What I Actually Built" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The POC is a Streamlit app that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Accepts a PDF upload</li>
<li class="">Chunks and embeds the text using OpenAI's embedding model</li>
<li class="">Stores the vectors in ChromaDB</li>
<li class="">Accepts questions in a chat interface</li>
<li class="">Retrieves the top K relevant chunks and sends them to the LLM</li>
<li class="">Returns an answer with source citations showing which parts of the document it drew from</li>
</ul>
<p>Three components, each independently tuneable:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>What It Does</th><th>What I Used</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PDF Processor</td><td>Extracts and chunks the text</td><td>pypdf + LangChain text splitter</td></tr><tr><td>Embedding Model</td><td>Converts chunks to vectors for search</td><td>text-embedding-3-small</td></tr><tr><td>LLM</td><td>Generates answers from retrieved chunks</td><td>gpt-4o-mini</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="tuning-it--what-actually-changes-responses">Tuning It — What Actually Changes Responses<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2026/02/14/rag-poc#tuning-it--what-actually-changes-responses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tuning It — What Actually Changes Responses" title="Direct link to Tuning It — What Actually Changes Responses" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>This is where it got interesting.</p>
<p>The first answers I got were technically correct but flat. Too literal. The model was pulling exact phrases from the document and reciting them without much synthesis. I started tuning.</p>
<p><strong>The prompt template</strong> made the biggest difference. Changing how I framed the task — what tone to use, how to handle uncertainty, whether to synthesize across chunks or quote directly — changed the response quality significantly. This is free to change and has no latency cost.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature</strong> was the one that surprised me most. At low temperature (around 0.1–0.2), the model becomes very conservative. It sticks close to exact wording in the retrieved chunks. If the question uses slightly different phrasing than the document, it can fail to connect them — even when a human would obviously see the relationship. It's not that the answer is wrong; it's that it's too literal.</p>
<p>Raising the temperature to around 0.5–0.7 made the responses more natural and better at bridging paraphrase gaps. The model was more willing to interpret rather than just recite. For factual Q&amp;A, somewhere in the 0.3–0.5 range felt like the right balance — enough flexibility to handle varied phrasing, not so much that it starts drifting from what's actually in the document.</p>
<p>The other parameters worth knowing:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>RETRIEVAL_K</strong> — how many chunks get passed to the LLM. More chunks = more context. Going from 3 to 6 noticeably improved answers on complex questions where context was spread across the document.</li>
<li class=""><strong>CHUNK_SIZE / CHUNK_OVERLAP</strong> — smaller chunks give more precise retrieval but can miss context that spans paragraphs. Larger chunks capture more context but can bring in irrelevant content. Changing these requires re-indexing everything.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2026/02/14/rag-poc#the-bottom-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Bottom Line" title="Direct link to The Bottom Line" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>RAG is conceptually simple. Two phases, three components. The hard part is understanding which component to adjust when the answers aren't good enough — and right now, the fastest levers are the prompt template, retrival chunks and temperature.</p>
<p>LangChain and ChromaDB are the right tools to start with. They get you to a working system quickly so you can focus on what actually matters: the quality of retrieval and the quality of the prompts.</p>
<p>Once you've got that, you peel back the abstraction and build it the hard way. That's where the real understanding is. Next up: rebuilding this without LangChain — raw API calls, custom chunking, manual prompt construction — to see exactly what the framework was doing for me.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Why I moved away from a Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site to Docusaurus, how Claude helped me get there, and the small gotcha that caused a 404 on launch day.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'd been running this blog on a Jekyll theme for a while. It worked, but I wanted to change the theme and the layput and it was not easy. The friction was real.</p>
<p>I had heard about Docusaurus - React-based, clean defaults, built for content. I was curious enough to try it.</p>
<p>Here's the thing - I didn't want to spend days on migration. I wanted a working site in a weekend. So I brought Claude into the process from the start.</p>
<p><strong>Getting the Environment Ready</strong></p>
<p>First step: Node. Docusaurus requires Node 18 or higher. I already had it installed, but if you're starting from scratch, the <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Node.js site</a> has straightforward installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<p>Once Node was in place, scaffolding the project took one command:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">npx create-docusaurus@latest my-blog classic</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This sets up everything — the folder structure, default blog, config file, and a local dev server. I chose the <code>classic</code> preset because it includes the blog plugin out of the box, which is all I needed.</p>
<p><strong>Where Claude Came In</strong></p>
<p>I asked Claude to walk me through the migration. I explained what I had (a Jekyll site with a handful of blog posts and a few pages) and what I wanted (a Docusaurus blog with the same content, without docs or a landing page).</p>
<p>The back-and-forth was genuinely useful. Claude flagged things I hadn't thought about — like turning off the docs plugin entirely, setting up the blog as the homepage, and making sure the frontmatter format matched what Docusaurus expected.</p>
<p>I didn't follow every suggestion blindly. Some recommendations needed adjusting once I saw how my specific setup worked. But having that starting point saved me from reading through the entire Docusaurus docs before writing a single line of config.</p>
<p><strong>Migrating the Posts</strong></p>
<p>I didn't move everything at once. I picked one post, copied it into the <code>blog/</code> folder, adjusted the frontmatter, and ran the local server:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">npm start</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The post showed up. The formatting looked right. That small proof of concept gave me the confidence to move the rest.</p>
<p>The main frontmatter difference from Jekyll: Docusaurus uses <code>tags</code> as an array directly in YAML, and it's stricter about dates matching the filename. I moved the remaining five posts in one go, ran the server again, and everything rendered cleanly.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Up Deployment</strong></p>
<p>For GitHub Pages, I created a GitHub Actions workflow at <code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml</code>. The workflow runs on every push to <code>main</code>, builds the site inside the <code>my-blog/</code> folder, and pushes the output to a <code>gh-pages</code> branch using the <code>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages</code> action.</p>
<p>I committed everything and pushed.</p>
<p><strong>The Gotcha</strong></p>
<p>The workflow ran successfully. The <code>gh-pages</code> branch was created. But the site showed a 404.</p>
<p>Turned out the GitHub Pages source was still pointing to the <code>main</code> branch — left over from the old Jekyll setup. The fix took thirty seconds: <strong>Settings → Pages → Source → branch: gh-pages, folder: /</strong></p>
<p>That was it. The site came up immediately after saving.</p>
<p><strong>Styling Tweaks</strong></p>
<p>Once the content was live, I made a few small adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Replaced the default green color scheme with blue f — one CSS variable change that cascades through titles, tags, and the active nav tab</li>
<li class="">Removed the Docusaurus logo</li>
<li class="">Added <code>description</code> frontmatter to all posts for proper meta descriptions in search results</li>
</ul>
<p>Each change was small, but together they made the site feel like mine rather than a starter template.</p>
<p><strong>Was It Worth It?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I liked the layout of Docusaurus more and it is node based.</p>
<p>The migration took a couple of hours. Most of that time was configuration and testing, not content work. The content moved cleanly because Markdown is Markdown.</p>
<p>If your current blog setup feels like a black box and you find yourself avoiding changes because you don't know what will break, it might be time for a rebuild. Start with one post, run it locally, see how it feels.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best reason to migrate is just that you'll actually enjoy maintaining it afterward.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A practical explainer on AI agents — how they differ from regular chat AI, how the agent loop works, and what it means for teams starting to adopt them.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been hearing a lot about AI agents - what they are, how they differ from regular ChatGPT/Copilot. Here's what I've learned from working with them.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-actually-is-an-ai-agent">What Actually Is an AI Agent?<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2026/01/10/aiagents#what-actually-is-an-ai-agent" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Actually Is an AI Agent?" title="Direct link to What Actually Is an AI Agent?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Here's the thing - when you use ChatGPT or Copilot, you ask a question, get an answer, then ask another question. It's a conversation. You're in control of every step.</p>
<p>AI agents flip this dynamic. You give them a goal, and they figure out how to get there. They don't wait for you to tell them what to do next - they plan, execute, check results, adjust, and keep going until the job is done.</p>
<p>Think of it like the difference between giving someone turn-by-turn directions versus just telling them the destination. One requires constant input from you; the other handles navigation independently.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-agent-loop---how-it-works">The Agent Loop - How It Works<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2026/01/10/aiagents#the-agent-loop---how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Agent Loop - How It Works" title="Direct link to The Agent Loop - How It Works" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Behind the scenes, AI agents run what's called an "agent loop." It's basically a cycle that repeats until your task is complete:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Remember what's happened so far</li>
<li class="">Decide what to do next</li>
<li class="">Execute the action</li>
<li class="">Check the result</li>
<li class="">Update the memory with what worked (or didn't)</li>
<li class="">Decide whether to continue or stop</li>
</ul>
<p>It's how you'd work through a complex project yourself - except the agent does this in minutes instead of hours.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-makes-up-an-ai-agent">What Makes Up an AI Agent?<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2026/01/10/aiagents#what-makes-up-an-ai-agent" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Makes Up an AI Agent?" title="Direct link to What Makes Up an AI Agent?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Memory</strong><br>
<!-- -->The agent's record of what's happened. It tracks your request, what actions it's taken, what worked, what failed. Without memory, the agent would repeat mistakes or lose track of progress.</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong><br>
<!-- -->These define what the agent can and cannot do. Think of rules as the agent's job description - its boundaries, capabilities, and guidelines for behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Tools</strong><br>
<!-- -->The actual functions the agent can perform. Read files. Query databases. Send emails. Search the web. Create reports. Without tools, the agent can only talk about doing things - it can't actually do them.</p>

<p><strong>Regular Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">You: "Write a product description"</li>
<li class="">AI: [writes description]</li>
<li class="">You: "Make it shorter"</li>
<li class="">AI: [makes it shorter]</li>
<li class="">You: "Check it against brand voice"</li>
<li class="">AI: [checks it]</li>
</ul>
<p>You're driving every step.</p>
<p><strong>Agentic AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">You: "Create a product description that matches our brand voice and is under 150 words"</li>
<li class="">AI: "Let me check your brand guidelines... drafting... checking word count... making adjustments... Done. Here's the description."</li>
</ul>
<p>The AI is driving.</p>

<p><strong>Flipped Interaction</strong><br>
<!-- -->Instead of you asking 20 questions, the AI might ask you 2-3 clarifying questions upfront, then goes off and completes the work.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Planning</strong><br>
<!-- -->Hits a roadblock? The agent adjusts its approach. Missing information? It searches for it or asks you. Error in step 3? It modifies steps 4 and 5 accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Translation Layer</strong><br>
<!-- -->You say: "Pull last quarter's support tickets and identify common issues."<br>
<!-- -->The agent translates that into database queries, data analysis, pattern recognition, and report generation.<br>
<!-- -->You get: A summary without writing code or manually reviewing hundreds of tickets.</p>

<p>One task that comes up regularly in documentation work is reviewing UI literals - the text strings that appear in software interfaces like button labels, error messages, and menu items.</p>
<p><strong>The Old Way:</strong><br>
<!-- -->The developers sends over a spreadsheet with new UI literals for an upcoming release. The writer needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Check each literal against our style guide rules (capitalization, punctuation, word choice)</li>
<li class="">Get clarity from the product team on the context and requirements</li>
<li class="">Comes from multiple developers, in sprints</li>
</ul>
<p>This takes several hours of focused, tedious work. Miss one inconsistency, and it ships to users.</p>
<p><strong>With an AI Agent:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Give the agent: "Review these 200 new literals against our style guide rules and our verified literal list. Flag anything that doesn't match patterns or rules."</p>
<p>The agent:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Loads the style guide rules (title casing, no periods in labels, specific terminology requirements)</li>
<li class="">Compares each new literal against the guidelines</li>
<li class="">Identifies 23 literals that don't follow capitalization rules</li>
<li class="">Flags 8 literals using terminology that differs from established patterns (like "Remove" vs standard "Delete")</li>
<li class="">Creates a report categorizing issues by type with specific recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>The writer reviews the flagged items, gets clarity from the product team, and does the needful. The pattern-matching work? Handled.</p>
<p>What makes this powerful is consistency. The agent doesn't get tired on literal 150 and start missing things. It applies the same rigor to every single item.</p>

<p><strong>Simple Reflex Agents</strong><br>
<!-- -->Follow basic "if this, then that" rules. If someone asks about pricing, show the pricing page. Straightforward but limited.</p>
<p><strong>Goal-Based Agents</strong><br>
<!-- -->Work toward specific objectives. "Identify the inconsistencies in the terminologies used, and provide steps to fix the," The agent figures out how to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Let me be clear - AI agents aren't magic.</p>
<p><strong>You're Still the Boss</strong><br>
<!-- -->Set the goals. Define the rules. Review the results. The agent executes; you provide strategy and judgment.</p>
<p><strong>Start Small</strong><br>
<!-- -->Test with low-risk tasks first. Don't hand over mission-critical work until you've seen how the agent performs on simpler tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Oversight Matters</strong><br>
<!-- -->Agents make mistakes. They can go off track. You need to review their work, especially initially.</p>
<p><strong>Human Judgment Can't Be Replaced</strong><br>
<!-- -->Use agents for execution and coordination. Keep strategic thinking, ethical considerations, and creative decisions in human hands.</p>

<p><strong>More Time for Strategy</strong><br>
<!-- -->Your team spends less time on repetitive tasks and more time on work that actually needs human creativity and judgment.</p>

<p>Identify one repetitive, multi-step task that eats up your team's time. That's your first candidate for an AI agent.</p>
<p>It might be:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Generating status reports from multiple data sources</li>
<li class="">Reviewing and categorizing customer feedback</li>
<li class="">Creating first drafts of proposals from templates</li>
<li class="">Monitoring compliance across multiple systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Pick something where the process is clear, the inputs are structured, and the stakes aren't too high if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Test it. Refine it. Expand from there.</p>

<p>AI agents aren't just fancy chatbots. They're systems that can handle complex, multi-step work with minimal hand-holding.</p>
<p>The technology is here. It's getting better fast. Companies figuring out how to use it effectively will have a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The question isn't whether AI agents will change how we work - they already are. The question is: How will you put them to work on your team?</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A practical walkthrough of ML problems with both categorical and numerical targets — what changes in your pipeline, how to encode correctly, which metrics to use, and the gotchas to watch out for.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you start working through ML practice problems, you'll notice that two problems can look almost identical — same preprocessing steps, same train/test split structure — but one has a price as the target and the other has a category. That difference changes several things in your pipeline.</p>
<p>This post walks through real scenarios from both sides and highlights what to watch out for at each step.</p>

<li class=""><strong>R²</strong> tells you how much of the price variance your model explains. 0.85 means 85% explained — the higher the better.</li>
<li class=""><strong>MAE</strong> tells you the average error in the same unit as your target (e.g., dollars). Easy to interpret.</li>
<li class=""><strong>RMSE</strong> penalises large errors more heavily than MAE. If RMSE is much higher than MAE, your model has a few big misses worth investigating.</li>

<p><strong>Watch out:</strong> KNN and SVR require scaled features — they use distance calculations. Random Forest and Decision Tree do not require scaling. In this problem, scaling is applied to all models before any of them are trained, so all four get the same prepared data.</p>

<p>The <code>Churn</code> column contains string values (<code>'Yes'</code>/<code>'No'</code>). Most classifiers accept string targets directly, but being explicit is better:</p>

<p>LabelEncoder assigns integers (0, 1, 2...) to categories. This is fine for Random Forest because trees split on thresholds — the numeric ordering doesn't imply a false relationship. For linear or distance-based models, use <code>pd.get_dummies()</code> instead.</p>

<p>For churn, <strong>Recall matters more than Precision</strong> — missing a customer who is about to churn (False Negative) is more costly than flagging one who wasn't going to (False Positive). Accuracy alone can mislead you if most customers don't churn.</p>

<li class=""><strong>Always start simple</strong> — Linear/Logistic Regression first. A strong baseline is more useful than jumping straight to complex models.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Understand your data</strong> — Dataset size, feature types, and noise level all affect which model to reach for.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Pick metrics based on business context</strong> — A high accuracy score can hide a useless model on imbalanced data. Know the cost of FP vs FN in your problem.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Feature engineering often beats model complexity</strong> — Clean, relevant features matter more than which model you pick.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Cross-validate</strong> — A single train/test split can mislead you. Use cross-validation for a reliable performance estimate.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[Field notes from using Microsoft Enterprise Copilot as a technical writer — prompting strategies, real use cases, and what actually works for drafting and reviewing docs.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I shared my experience with <a class="" href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2025/08/08/msty">Msty as an AI aggregator</a> for personal AI projects. Today, I want to talk about how in work we use Enterprise Copilot in the technical writers team.</p>
<p>Here's the thing - documentation work involves a lot of back-and-forth. You get requirements documents, user stories, and sometimes details in emails. Your job is to comprehend and abstract the data to create user guides and release notes. It takes time, multiple drafts, and constant clarifications because information is scattered and not complete.</p>
<p>In our organization, we have access to Enterprise Copilot, and due to data privacy issues, other AI chat tools are not allowed for project work.</p>
<p><strong>From Blank Pages to First Drafts</strong></p>
<p>Before Copilot, creating the first draft took time. New features or technical terms would come up without context, and would need to spend hours figuring out what they meant. The gap in details or context could lead to incomplete documentation and more review cycles.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with Copilot cautiously - simple prompts for language review. Generic requests like "improve this text" gave mediocre results. But when I got specific - "Review this paragraph for passive voice" or "Check if this matches our conversational tone" - the output improved.</p>
<p>It became clear that to get the expected outcome, Co-pilot required  clear instructions.</p>
<p><strong>How I Actually Use It</strong></p>
<p>Training and guidelines are given to the team members on how to use Copilot. There is a set of prompt templates created for the various tasks in the team. If there are tweaks required for different products, the template is customized as required. This helps junior team members to generate drafts faster without starting from scratch. Also, it ensures that the output is consistent in tone and style.</p>
<p>For example: "Based on this SRS document, explain the core user workflow for [Product Name] in simple terms. List any assumptions you're making."</p>
<p>This surfaces gaps early and gives everyone a solid starting point.</p>
<p>For style consistency, I use specific prompts: "Review this section for conversational tone, active voice, and second-person perspective. Highlight deviations." It catches inconsistencies before documents reach reviewers.</p>
<p><strong>Finding What's Missing</strong></p>
<p>One trick I love - using different personas to test the documents. I ask Copilot: "Act as a developer implementing this API. What information is missing? What questions would you have?"</p>
<p>Or: "Act as a business analyst explaining this feature to stakeholders. What's unclear?"</p>
<p>This helps me spot gaps and create a list of questions for SMEs and product owners before lengthy review cycles start.</p>
<p><strong>Working with Multiple Documents</strong></p>
<p>Enterprise Copilot's ability to work with OneDrive links is useful. Instead of opening five different documents to cross-reference information, I upload links and query: "What are the differences in how authentication is described across these five documents?"</p>
<p>This surfaces inconsistencies and helps me create accurate abstractions of complex requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Templates Faster</strong></p>
<p>Recently, when we needed a new document template, I asked Copilot to draft an outline based on the template's purpose, our existing formats, and standards. The initial draft wasn't perfect, but it accelerated iterations with the product team. What would have taken multiple meetings, happened in 1-2 focused sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Building Glossaries</strong></p>
<p>Identifying terms for glossaries manually is a time-consuming activity. Now I upload documentation and ask: "Identify technical terms and acronyms that would need definitions for a non-technical audience."</p>
<p>It's not always perfect - sometimes it flags common terms or misses domain-specific terms - but it gives a solid starting list to refine.</p>
<p><strong>The Reality Check</strong></p>
<p>Let me be clear: Enterprise Copilot isn't a silver bullet.</p>
<p>Generic prompts don't work. Different products have different input documents and formats. A prompt that works beautifully for one product may produce less desirable output for another. I've had to fine-tune prompts for each scenario and teach my junior team members how to customize them for specific tasks.</p>
<p>Guided adoption is critical. Initially, I told the team, "We have Copilot now, explore and use it." Adoption was slow. When I started showing them exactly how to use it for their daily tasks - "Here's how you generate a first draft of user guide from user stories" - adoption improved dramatically. When guided for their daily tasks, people actually use it.</p>
<p>Always keep a human in the loop. I treat Copilot as a partner or thought assistant, not a replacement for critical thinking. Every output needs review. Every draft needs validation against source documents. AI accelerates the process; it doesn't make you less responsible.</p>
<p>Know when NOT to use it. For repetitive tasks that can be automated with Excel functions or scripts, I don't ask Copilot to generate the final output. Instead, I ask it how to use the right functions or create the script. For example: "What Excel function extracts dates from text in this format?" This teaches me the underlying skill rather than making me dependent on AI for every small task.</p>
<p><strong>The Real Impact</strong></p>
<p>Using Enterprise Copilot has genuinely accelerated my documentation lifecycle. Drafts happen faster. Review cycles are shorter. Cross-functional collaboration is smoother. The team feels more confident experimenting with documentation early in the process.</p>
<p>But the tool is only as good as how you use it. Fine-tune your prompts. Understand your workflows. Keep learning. And always keep the human in the loop.</p>
<p>The core principle I started with remains true: GenAI accelerates content, streamlines processes, and manages knowledge efficiently. But how you implement it - the prompts you write, the workflows you design, the adoption strategies you use - that's where the real work happens.</p>
<p>And that work? It's worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Who Should Try This?</strong></p>
<p>If you are a knowledge worker and your organization has Enterprise Copilot (or similar tools), experiment with it hands-on. Start small with language review, then expand to drafting, then to gap analysis.</p>
<p>Better yet, show your junior team members exactly how to use it for their specific tasks. Don't just say "use AI" - demonstrate the actual prompts and workflows that work.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best tools are the ones that stay out of your way and let you focus on getting things done. Enterprise Copilot does that for me - not by replacing my work, but by accelerating the parts that used to slow everything down.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Practical guide to GroupBy and aggregation using business scenarios — sales performance, campaign ROI, and support ticket analysis. Covers the gotchas learners commonly hit.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you work with real datasets, raw rows rarely tell the story — you need to roll them up. GroupBy is how you do that.</p>
<p>In these scenarios the data comes in as individual transactions or records, but the business question is always at a higher level: <em>How did each Sales Manager's team perform? Which Marketing Manager ran the most efficient campaigns? Which Team Lead resolves tickets the fastest?</em></p>
<p>This post walks through three of those scenarios and highlights the things that trip people up along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Watch out — <code>count()</code> vs <code>nunique()</code>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><code>count()</code> counts all non-null rows in the group</li>
<li class=""><code>nunique()</code> counts how many <em>distinct</em> values exist</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use <code>count()</code> to measure Team Size, you'll get the number of transactions, not the number of unique salespeople. Use <code>nunique()</code> when the question is "how many different X".</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="as_indexfalse--when-do-you-need-it"><code>as_index=False</code> — when do you need it?<a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2025/09/13/pandas-groupby#as_indexfalse--when-do-you-need-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to as_indexfalse--when-do-you-need-it" title="Direct link to as_indexfalse--when-do-you-need-it" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>By default, the column you group by becomes the index of the result:</p>

<p>Use <code>as_index=False</code> to keep it as a regular column — especially useful when you want to merge the result back into another DataFrame:</p>

<p>Alternatively, chain <code>.reset_index()</code> after <code>.agg()</code> — same effect. Pick one and be consistent. With <code>.agg()</code>, the habit of ending with <code>.reset_index()</code> is cleaner since you're already building multiple columns at once.</p>

<p><strong>Dataset:</strong> Individual campaign executions — each row is one campaign run with columns for Marketing Manager, Budget, Revenue, Impressions, Clicks, and Conversions.</p>

<p>The key insight: <strong>you can't calculate ROI inside <code>.agg()</code></strong>. <code>.agg()</code> operates column by column. ROI needs both Revenue and Budget — two columns. So the pattern is: aggregate to get the totals, then derive the metrics on the resulting DataFrame.</p>

<p>This keeps the logic clean — aggregation in one block, derived metrics in a second block.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want formatted output (e.g., currency or percentage strings), do that as a final display step, not on the working columns. Keep the numeric columns numeric so you can still sort or filter on them.</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Team-level summary with average resolution time, satisfaction rate, and count of critical tickets handled.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[How Msty lets you connect multiple AI APIs (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) under one roof and pay only for what you use, without monthly subscription lock-in.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="https://msty.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Msty</a>, and it solved a problem I'd been having for some time.</p>
<p>Here's the thing - I wanted to try ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro, but I'm not a heavy AI user. Paying $20 every month when I might use it a few times felt like throwing money away.</p>
<p>Some days you're in the mood to experiment, but the free tier isn't enough. Msty solved this perfectly - you just plug in your API key and pay for what you use. No monthly guilt, no "I better use this 20 times to get my money's worth" pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Switching Between Different AI Models</strong></p>
<p>What's cool is you can connect multiple APIs - Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, you name it. I can ask the same question to different models and compare their responses. Ever wondered, "Would GPT-4 answer this differently than Claude?" Now you can find out without juggling different apps.</p>
<p>The whole setup works seamlessly without making you mess with API endpoints or technical configurations.</p>
<p>They also let you run smaller models locally on your machine for basic tasks. You get a list of featured local models with compatibility scores for your laptop. One glance tells you which model suits your needs and hardware best.</p>
<p>It's like having a Swiss Army knife for AI.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Stack - Your Personal AI Library</strong></p>
<p>This feature genuinely impressed me. You can upload your documents and use either local or remote AI models for embeddings. The settings are customizable, but the defaults work fine for most cases.</p>
<p>I tested this for my kid's exam prep. After uploading previous years' question papers, I asked Claude (through Msty) to generate similar practice questions. The results were spot-on. The AI understood the format, difficulty level, and topics - creating new questions that matched the requirements.</p>
<p>Setting up took minutes. Paste your API key, drag and drop your files, and done. They even recommend which local models will run smoothly on your specific hardware.</p>
<p><strong>The Real Cost Savings</strong></p>
<p>Instead of paying for subscriptions I barely use, my actual API usage costs under $1 per month. For someone who needs AI occasionally but wants the best models when I do, this approach makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Running local models for simple tasks cuts costs even further.</p>
<p><strong>Who Should Try This?</strong></p>
<p>If you're a beginner wanting access to top-tier models without expensive monthly commitments, Msty is worth exploring. It's handy for personal projects where your AI needs fluctuate. Some weeks, I don't do any AI learning; other weeks, I'm experimenting with AI. Now I only pay for what I use.</p>
<p>I found Msty a powerful ally. It's not trying to be everything to everyone - just a straightforward way to access AI models without subscription overhead.</p>
<p>Give it a try if you're on the fence about AI subscriptions but still want to experiment with the good stuff. Sometimes the best tools are the ones that stay out of your way and let you focus on getting things done.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tip:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Use np.nan to replace with NaN.</li>
<li class="">Use the regex=True argument to match patterns (e.g., all whitespace or special characters).</li>
<li class="">Set inplace=True to modify the DataFrame directly.</li>
<li class="">These patterns work for spaces, slashes, or any regex you specify!</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Driving content systems evolution and GenAI adoption for a multi-product digital banking suite</strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="-from-sharepoint-to-sitecore-a-strategic-platform-shift">🔧 <strong>From SharePoint to Sitecore: A Strategic Platform Shift</strong><a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2025/07/28/project1#-from-sharepoint-to-sitecore-a-strategic-platform-shift" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -from-sharepoint-to-sitecore-a-strategic-platform-shift" title="Direct link to -from-sharepoint-to-sitecore-a-strategic-platform-shift" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>In 2022, I led the full migration of our enterprise knowledge portal — not because it failed, but because it outgrew its purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Why we moved:</strong></p>
<p>SharePoint 2013 was reaching end-of-life, and our product suite had evolved from monolithic apps to a platform-based, microservices architecture. The old Information Architecture couldn’t scale with this growth, and our SharePoint portal dev team had migrated to open-source stacks. We needed a <strong>future-ready, flexible platform</strong> — fast.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>
<p>My manager and I evaluated different platform options, presented a Sitecore business case to senior leadership, and got approval. Then came the heavy lift:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Redesigned the IA</strong> to reflect the new product structure while mapping 1TB of legacy content into the new model.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Remodeled metadata strategy</strong> to ensure search relevance and scalability.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Coordinated across multiple teams</strong> — product, engineering, security, data privacy, infra — to align with enterprise standards.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Partnered with the implementation team</strong> to test each feature under tight delivery timelines and provide ongoing feedback.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Drove launch readiness</strong> — created onboarding guides, planned internal/external comms, and incorporated user feedback into post-launch refinements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Result: A modern, secure, scalable publishing platform that supports evolving product architecture and accelerates future AI integration.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="-genai-enablement-at-scale">💬 <strong>GenAI Enablement at Scale</strong><a href="https://ejsumi.github.io/2025/07/28/project1#-genai-enablement-at-scale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -genai-enablement-at-scale" title="Direct link to -genai-enablement-at-scale" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>While I didn’t build KnowledgeGPT myself, I played a major role in its adoption and rollout:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Collaborated with the AI team to bring <strong>ChatGPT-style search</strong> into the knowledge platform.</li>
<li class="">Led prompt strategy and internal use-case validation.</li>
<li class="">Rolled out tools like a <strong>language review assistant</strong> and a <strong>prompt repository</strong>, helping our writers extract, comprehend, and standardize content, reducing review overhead by 70%.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class="">Manage the <strong>publishing portal roadmap</strong>: features, releases, vendor collaboration, and continuous UX improvements.</li>
<li class="">Onboard and support partners, internal teams, and customers across content access and usage.</li>
<li class="">Leading a team of 5, handling the knowledge platform and content delivery of Digital Banking products, while coordinating across multiple teams.</li>
